      "As a front-end JavaScript developer on an ISP project, I helped turn MikroTik routers into cloud-managed Wi-Fi routers. By copying and pasting our RouterOS script onto the routers, we enabled centralized control of a fleet of MikroTik routers from a cloud dashboard. With this system, we could easily configure, monitor, and manage MikroTik routers alongside OpenWRT, SNMP, and TR-069 CWMP devices. \nOur system also provided valuable insights, such as email alerts for offline routers, the number of Wi-Fi connected devices and their signal strengths, latency charts, real-time traffic and bandwidth charts, and a browser web shell for remote terminal access. Plus, we used ISPApp bulk commands or server API to perform tasks like firmware upgrades, password changes, internet plan speed settings, and auto-disconnection of delinquent subscribers who don't pay. \n Through my work as a front-end developer on this project, I helped create a powerful and user-friendly system that simplified router management for our clients.",
