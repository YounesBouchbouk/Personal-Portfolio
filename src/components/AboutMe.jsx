            ðŸš€ I'm a Full Stack Engineer with an engineering degree and over 2 years of professional experience building modern web applications. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with a particular focus on JavaScript/TypeScript and Golang ecosystems.
            <br />
            <br />
            I currently work as a Full Stack Engineer at 21Factory, where I develop and maintain a SaaS platform built with Go microservices and React. I've built an event booking system using Domain-Driven Design principles and Hexagonal Architecture, which has deepened my expertise in Go while maintaining my React skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            Previously, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at ispapp.co (2022-2024), where I developed and maintained a cloud-based network management system for Internet Service Providers. I built reactive user interfaces with Next.js and developed scalable backend services using NestJS and Go.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also completed a 6-month internship at Oracle Labs, where I worked on the GraalVM and Graal Cloud Native ecosystem as a Software Developer. This experience strengthened my backend development skills and gave me valuable experience with Java and cloud technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            My technical toolkit includes:
            â€¢ Frontend: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
            â€¢ Backend: Golang, Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, Java (Spring Boot)
            â€¢ Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis
            â€¢ DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm passionate about building efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies and approaches. I'm particularly interested in microservices architecture, cloud-native applications, and real-time systems.
