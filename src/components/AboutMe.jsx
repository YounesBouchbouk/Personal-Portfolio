            ðŸš€ I'm Younes Bouchbouk, Full Stack web developer with an engineering degree. I have a strong background in front-end and back-end development.
            <br />
            From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and its ability to transform the way we live and work. As a Full-Stack  developer, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from building responsive websites to developing complex web applications. This experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the entire development process, from concept to deployment.

            <br />
            I want to let you know that I have one year of experience as a React and Next.js developer at a startup located in the US. Additionally, I spent nine months as a Software Developer Intern at the Oracle Research and Development Center as back-end engineer.

            <br />
            I believe that my skills in HTML/CSS/JS , React.Js , Next.Js and TailwindCss for front-end and GO, Node.Js and JAVA and for back-end , combined with my ability to solve complex problems and adapt and learn quickly, make me a great fit for any role.
